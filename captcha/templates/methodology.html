                    DrCaptcha is an interactive machine learning application. The purpose of the program is to the
                    feedback provided by users, and to use it to optimize a machine learning model. The purpose of this
                    model is to recognize handwritten letters and numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>How it works?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    DrCaptcha initially provides users with a CAPTCHA. Then the system compares the values given
                    by the user to the values stored for the captcha. If these values match then the system
                    recognizes that the user is a human, otherwise not.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <img style="width: 700px;height: auto" src="{% static 'images/methodology.png'%}" alt="methodology">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The difference between this system and the classic captcha systems is that the system itself,
                    for some of the images, does not know the labels. In the example of the figure below, the system
                    may have labels for the characters e, a, A, and T, while it does not have characters O and M.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <img style="width: 700px;height: auto" src="{% static 'images/methodology-2.png'%}" alt="methodology2">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When the system verifies that the user input matches the data in the database, then it will take
                    the user's input ​​for the non-classified characters, and will classify them according to the
                    values ​​given by the user. In the case where the user input is incorrect, the system will not
                    proceed to character classification. In this way, the user provides implicit feedback to the
                    system by classifying characters, which will later be used to train machine learning models.
                    With the classified characters, the application trains some artificial neural networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we finish training neural networks, an administrator can create an ensemble of neural networks
                    and assign weights to them. This whole acts as a meta-model that takes the predictions from the
                    models that make it up and then decides based on what prediction to give as a result. When the user
                    creates or makes a change to this ensemble, the application evaluates and stores its parameters.
